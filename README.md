# 🎨 Skribbl Clone

A full-stack, real-time multiplayer drawing and guessing game — a clone of [skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io).

## 🌐 Live Demo
> **https://your-skribbl-clone.onrender.com** ← Update after deploying

## 🗺️ What Is This Project?

Skribbl Clone is a real-time multiplayer Pictionary-style web game where:
- Players join a **room** (public or private) using a room code
- Each round, one player is the **drawer** — they pick a secret word and draw it on a shared canvas
- All other players **guess the word** by typing in chat
- **Correct guesses earn points** — faster guesses earn more points
- The drawer also earns points for each correct guesser
- After all players have drawn, the player with the **most points wins**

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Local Development)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+ installed
- Two terminal windows

### Step 1 — Clone / unzip the project
```bash
cd skribbl-clone
```

### Step 2 — Install all dependencies
```bash
# Install root dev dependencies
npm install

# Install server dependencies
npm install --prefix server

# Install client dependencies
npm install --prefix client
```

### Step 3 — Start the development servers

**Terminal 1 — Backend (port 3001):**
```bash
npm run dev:server
```

**Terminal 2 — Frontend (port 5173):**
```bash
npm run dev:client
```

Or start both simultaneously (requires concurrently):
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4 — Open the game
Navigate to **http://localhost:5173** in your browser.

To test multiplayer, open the URL in **multiple browser tabs** or different devices on the same network.

### OOP Server Architecture

| Class | Responsibility |
|-------|---------------|
| `Room` | Manages player list, host, settings, leaderboard, delegates to Game |
| `Game` | Manages phase transitions, word selection, hint system, canvas strokes, scoring |
| `Player` | Stores per-player state: score, drawing/guessed flags, avatar |
| `MessageHandler` | Handles all socket events, orchestrates Room/Game/Player interactions |

### Real-Time Drawing Sync

Drawing strokes are captured using normalized coordinates (0–1 range relative to canvas size), so they render correctly across different screen sizes:

1. **Drawer**: Mouse/touch events on `<canvas>` → normalized `{x, y}` → `draw_start/move/end` socket events
2. **Server**: Receives events → stores stroke array in `Game.canvasStrokes` → broadcasts via `draw_data`  
3. **Guessers**: Receive `draw_data` → multiply by canvas pixel dimensions → draw on their local canvas

The stroke array enables **canvas replay** for players joining mid-game and **undo** functionality.

### Scoring System

- **Guessers**: `max(50, 300 + timeBonus - orderPenalty)` — first correct guess scores highest
  - `timeBonus = (timeLeft / totalTime) * 200` — speed reward
  - `orderPenalty = guessOrder * 20` — later guessers score slightly less
- **Drawer**: +50 points per player who guesses correctly

### Word Matching

Server-side word matching in `Game.checkGuess()`:
```js
guess.trim().toLowerCase() === word.toLowerCase()
```
- Case-insensitive
- Whitespace-trimmed
- Exact match required (partial matches show as "close" if within edit distance 2)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Frontend | React 18 + TypeScript + Vite | Fast dev, type safety, component model |
| Canvas | HTML5 Canvas API | Native, performant, no external dependency |
| Routing | React Router v6 | SPA navigation |
| Backend | Node.js + Express | Lightweight, JS ecosystem |
| WebSockets | Socket.IO 4 | Reliable WS with fallback to polling |
| Styling | CSS + Inline styles | No build-time CSS deps needed |
| Fonts | Google Fonts (Fredoka One + Nunito) | Fun, readable game aesthetic |

## 🌐 Deployment

### Option A — Render (Recommended)

**Backend:**
1. Create a new **Web Service** on [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Connect your GitHub repo
3. Root Directory: `server`
4. Build Command: `npm install`
5. Start Command: `node index.js`
6. Add env var: `CLIENT_URL=https://your-frontend.onrender.com`

**Frontend:**
1. Create a new **Static Site** on Render
2. Root Directory: `client`
3. Build Command: `npm install && npm run build`
4. Publish Directory: `dist`
5. Add env var: `VITE_SERVER_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com`

### Option B — Railway

1. Create project from GitHub repo
2. Add two services: one for `server/`, one for `client/`
3. Set environment variables as above

### Option C — Vercel (Frontend) + Render (Backend)

1. Deploy `client/` to Vercel (auto-detects Vite)
2. Deploy `server/` to Render as a Web Service
3. In Vercel: add env var `VITE_SERVER_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com`

> **Important:** Socket.IO requires persistent WebSocket connections. Vercel serverless functions don't support this — always use Render/Railway for the backend.

## 🔑 Key Code Locations

| Feature | File |
|---------|------|
| WebSocket events | `server/MessageHandler.js` |
| Game logic / scoring | `server/Game.js` |
| Drawing capture | `client/src/components/DrawingCanvas.tsx` |
| Word matching | `server/Game.js → checkGuess()` |
| Room management | `server/Room.js` |
| Socket singleton | `client/src/hooks/useSocket.ts` |

---

## 📝 Notes

- Game state is **in-memory only** — rooms disappear if the server restarts (no database needed for MVP)
- Canvas uses **normalized coordinates** for cross-device consistency
- Socket.IO automatically falls back from WebSocket to HTTP long-polling if needed
